Hi! My name is 何昊洋 (hé hào yáng). I'm a current graduate student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, pursuing the degree of [Masters in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu). My capstone project is centered around building a safe human-interactive autonomous wheelchair system, working with [Cherie Ho](https://cherieho.com) and [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian) at the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org). I'm also working as teaching assistant for CMU [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) and [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu).

Previously, I obtained my [Integrated M.S./B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/integrated.html) here at CMU within 4 years, during which I interned at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) and [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com).

My research interests include multimodal machine learning, visual generation, and reinforcement learning, centered around multimodal learning for human-interactive robotic systems and generating embodied training data for these applications.

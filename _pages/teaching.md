description: I'm a firm believer that the best way to master something is by teaching others. I genuinely enjoy helping others understand topics that I'm personally interested in. It becomes even more rewarding when the students raise unique arguments that expand my view of the topics from different interpretations, and such discussions inspire me in my own learning. I sincerely recommend everyone to try it out!
